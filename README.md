# Docker-Py-ReVanced

A little python script that will help you in building [Revanced apps](#note) directly from GitHub. This fork support Youtube, Youtube Music, twitter, reddit, tiktok and WARNWETTER. The [original script] documentation is not as detailed as this one for newbies. So read the following. This fork has cleaned some unuseful actions like post to **telegram** and check APK with **Virus Total** api.

## Build

### ðŸš€ In GitHub (Recommended)

1. Fork the project

2. Add following **_repository secrets_** 
    - _GH_TOKEN_ (**required**) - GitHub token so that it can upload to GitHub and create release
       after building. See how to generate token [here](#generate-token).
    - _ENVS_ (optional but I recommand to custom as below) - required only if you want to cook specific apps/versions.

    <details>
      <summary>ðŸ›ˆ How to</summary>

      - Go to the repo settings to create the secret variables
        ![step_1]
        ![step_2]

      - **`ENVS`** secret might look like this
        (You should copy your **`ENVS`** content somewhere before saving because secret var can not be edited or copied after. Youâ€™ll have to click update to recreate from blank if you want change your **`ENVS`** settings.)

        ```ini
        PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter
        EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE=hide-cast-button,hide-autoplay-button,premium-heading,old-quality-layout,tablet-mini-player,always-autorepeat
        EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC=yt-music-is-shit
        YOUTUBE_VERSION=17.33.42
        YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=latest
        TWITTER_VERSION=latest
        ```
    </details>    
3. Go to actions tab. Select `Build Revanced APK`. Click on `Run Workflow`.
    - It can take a few minute to start. Just be patient.

    <details>
      <summary>ðŸ“– See report</summary>

      - access logs
        ![action_1]
        ![action_2]
        ![action_3]

    </details>  
4. If the building process is successful, youâ€™ll get your APKs in the releases

### Note

By default, script builds the version as recommended by Revanced team.

1. Supported values for **_<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>_** are :
   - youtube
   - youtube_music
   - twitter
   - reddit
   - tiktok
   - warnwetter
2. If you want to build a specific version . Add `version` in `environment` in the
   format
   ```ini
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=<VERSION>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=17.31.36
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=X.X.X
   TWITTER_VERSION=X.X.X
   REDDIT_VERSION=X.X.X
   TIKTOK_VERSION=X.X.X
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=X.X.X
   ```
   Check available versions on **APKMirror**.
   - [youtube]
   - [youtube music]
   - [twitter]
3. If you want to a `latest` version, whatever latest is available (excluding beta) .
   Add `latest` in `environment` in the format
   ```ini
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=latest
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=latest
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=latest
   TWITTER_VERSION=latest
   REDDIT_VERSION=latest
   TIKTOK_VERSION=latest
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=latest   
   ```
4. By default, it will build [all](#note) build app supported by Revanced team. If you
   don't
   want to waste time and build only few apps. Add the apps you want to build in
   `environment` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter
   ```
5. If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by placing it
   inside `apks` folder. And adding the name of `keystore-file` in `environment` like
   ```ini
    KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
6. If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `environment` in
   the format
   ```ini
   EXCLUDE_PATCH_<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>=<PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-1,PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-2>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE=custom-branding,hide-get-premium
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC=yt-music-is-shit
   ```
   Patches list available for all supported apps are [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/tree/main).
7. By default, the `--experimental` flag is used to allow patching new but untested apps releases.
    There is two ways to force the script only patches the apps releases supported and tested by ReVanced.
    1. Create a new **`ENVS`** and use `<APPNAME>_VERSION=<VERSION>`
    2. Edit the `main.py` file line 376 to change `is_experimental = True` to `is_experimental = False`
    
### Generate Token
1. Go to your account setting â†’ developper settings (at the bottom of the page)
2. Give it a meaningful name
![token 1]
3. Grant those permissions and valid
![token 2]
